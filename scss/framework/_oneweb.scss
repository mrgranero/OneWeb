 * WARNING!!
 * =========
 *
 * Avoid editing this file, or any file within the framework folder!
 * Doing so will make it impossible to update without breaking your template.
 * Alterations and additions should be made within UI folder only.
 *
 * From the UI folder it's easy to disable almost any part of the framework,
 * add to it or modify any aspect of it. Making modifications within the
 * framework folder is doing it the hard way!

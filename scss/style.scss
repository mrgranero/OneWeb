 * INTRODUCTION
 * ============
 *
 * Oneweb is an Object Orientated framework and so attempts to separate out
 * everything into re-usable modules. Unlike most other frameworks it tries
 * to abstract the 'design' away from the layout. The intention is that you
 * never have to do battle with the framework.
 *
 * Breaking everything down into maintainable, and easily digestible, chunks
 * makes it easy to find and change what you want and separating the basic
 * design constructs from their styling makes it possible to easily update
 * the framework without breaking your 'design'.
 *
 * HOW DOES IT WORK?
 * =================
 *
 * The Oneweb framework handles basic layout and provides all the css 'tools',
 * while the UI template does all the pretty stuff.
 *
 * This file pulls in the Oneweb framework and any modules that are enabled
 * by default. After that elements are styled by pulling in modules from the
 * UI folder.
 *
 * Modifications to the framework should be made ONLY by overriding its
 * defaults from within the UI template, using the _variables.scss file.
 *
 * Within the UI folder you can do almost anything you want. For example, if
 * you want to add some widgets to your template drop _widgets.scss into the
 * ui folder and then import _widgets.scss using this file. You can also
 * enable the import of any framework modules that are disabled by default,
 * simply by setting the use paramter to true, e.g.,
 *
 * $use-wells:             true;
 *
 * STYLEGUIDE
 * ==========
 *
 * For my sanity an yours Oneweb has been authored according to a styleguide,
 * STYLEGUIDE.md
 *

/*
 * _variables.scss overrides framework defaults, and enables optional modules,
 * so it needs to be loaded first.
 *
 *
 * Any variables you find set in framework/_defaults.scss should be overridden
 * in ui/_variables.scss.
